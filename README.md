# InjectionIII - overdue Swift rewrite of InjectionForXcode

![Icon](http://johnholdsworth.com/Syringe_128.png)

Code injection allows you to update the implementation of functions and any method of a class, struct or enum incrementally
in the iOS simulator without having to rebuild or restart your application. This saves the developer a significant amount of time tweaking code or iterating over a design.
This start-over implementation of [Injection for Xcode](https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode)
has been built into a standalone app: `InjectionIII.app` which runs in the status bar and is [available from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/injectioniii/id1380446739?mt=12).

`InjectionIII.app` expects to find an Xcode 1.2 or greater at the path `/Applications/Xcode.app` , works for `Swift` and `Objective-C` and can be used with [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/objc/create-a-swiftui-application.html).

To use injection, download and run the app and you must add "-Xlinker -interposable" to your project's "Other Linker Flags" for the debug target. Then, add one of the following to your application delegate's `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`

Xcode 10.2 and later (Swift 5+):

```Swift
#if DEBUG
Bundle(path: "/Applications/InjectionIII.app/Contents/Resources/iOSInjection.bundle")?.load()
//for tvOS:
Bundle(path: "/Applications/InjectionIII.app/Contents/Resources/tvOSInjection.bundle")?.load()
#endif
```

Adding one of these lines loads a bundle included in the `InjectionIII.app`'s
resources which connects over a localhost socket to the InjectionII app which runs on the task bar.
Once injection is connected, you'll be prompted to select the project directory for the app you wish to inject. This starts a `file watcher` in the Mac app so whenever
you save a Swift (or Objective-C) source in the project, the target app is messaged through the socket to compile, link, dynamically load and update the implementation of methods in the file being injected. 
The file watcher can be disabled & enabled while the app is running using the status bar menu and
when the file watcher is disabled you can still force injections through manually using a hotkey `ctrl-=` (remember to save the file first!)
If you inject a subclass of `XCTest` it will try running that individual test inside your application provided it does not require test specific support code.
When you run your application without rebuilding (^âŒ˜R), recent injections will be re-applied.

To detect when a class has been injected in your code (to reload a view controller for example) add an `@objc func
injected()` class or instance method.  The instance `@objc
func injected()` method relies on a "sweep" of all objects in your application to find those of
the class you have just injected which can be unreliable when using `unowned` instance variables. If you encounter problems, subscribe to the `"INJECTION_BUNDLE_NOTIFICATION"` instead.

If your project is organised across multiple directories, after you have selected the main project, you can add directories to be watched for file changes using the "Add Directory"
menu item. This list resets when you select a new project.

Included in this release is "Xprobe" which allows you to browse the objects in
your application through a web-like interface and execute code against them.

If you want to build this project from source (which you may need to do to use injection with macOS apps) you'll need to use:

    git clone https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionIII --recurse-submodules

### Limitations

This new release of InjectionIII works differently than previous versions in that you can now update the implementations of class, struct and enum methods (final or not) provided they have not been inlined which shouldn't be the case for a debug build. You cannot alter the layout of a class or struct in the course of an injection i.e. add or rearrange properties or your app will likely crash. Also, see the notes below for injecting `SwiftUI` views and how they type erasure.

If you are using Code Coverage, you will need to disable it or you may receive a:
>	`Symbol not found: ___llvm_profile_runtime` error.`

Go to `Edit Scheme -> Test -> Options -> Code Coverage` and (temporarily) disable.

Be mindful of global state -- If the file you're injecting has top level variables e.g. singletons, static or global vars
they will be reset when you inject the code as the new method implementations will refer to the newly loaded
version of the class.

As injection needs to know how to compile swift files individually it is incompatible with building using
`Whole Module Optimisation`. One workaround for this is to build with `WMO` switched off so there are
logs of individual compiles available then switching `WMO` back on if it suits your workflow better.

### Storyboard injection

Sometimes when you are iterating over a UI it is useful to be able to inject storyboards. This works slightly differently from code injection. To inject changes to a storyboard scene, make you changes than build the project instead of saving the storyboard. The "nib" of the currently displayed view controlled should be reloaded and viewDidLoad etc. will be called.

### SwiftUI Injection

It is possible to inject `SwiftUI` applications but if you add elements to an
interface or use modifiers that change the type type it changes the return type
of the view's body `Content` which will crash. To avoid this you just need to erase this
type. The easiest way to do this is add the following extension to your source
and use the modifier `.eraseToAnyView()` at the end of the declaration of
any view's body you want to iterate over:

```
extension View {
    #if DEBUG
    func eraseToAnyView() -> AnyView {
        return AnyView(self)
    }
    #else
    func eraseToAnyView() -> some View {
        return self
    }
    #endif
}
```
After this, putting the final touches to your interface interactively on a fully live app works fine.

### Vaccine

Injection now includes the higher level `Vaccine` functionality, for more information consult the [project README](https://github.com/zenangst/Vaccine) or one of the [following](https://medium.com/itch-design-no/code-injection-in-swift-c49be095414c) [references](https://medium.com/@robnorback/the-secret-to-1-second-compile-times-in-xcode-9de4ec8345a1).

### App Tracing

The InjectionIII menu contains an item "Trace" which can be used to enable logging of all Objective-C and non-final Swift class method calls. This feature is experimental. Selecting the menu item again will turn the feature back off.

If you want finer grain control of what is being traced, include the following file in your project's bridging header and the internal api will be available to Swift (after an injection bundle has been loaded):

```C++
#import "/Applications/InjectionIII.app/Contents/Resources/SwiftTrace.h"
```

For more information consult the [source repo](https://github.com/johnno1962/SwiftTrace).

### Remote Control

Newer versions of InjectionIII contain a server that allows you to control your development device from your desktop once it has been started. The UI allows you to record and replay macros of UI actions then verify the device screen against snapshots for end-to-end testing.

To use, add an Objective-C class to your project and `#import` its header file in the Swift bridging header. Include the following in the class *header* file:

```C++
#import "/Applications/InjectionIII.app/Contents/Resources/RemoteCapture.h"
```

Finally, include the following in your application's initialisation (replace
`192.168.1.14` with the IPV4 network address of your development 
machine or your colleague's machine you would like to project your device 
onto if they are running InjectionIII.) You can also use a machine's hostname
(shown in Preferences/Sharing):

```Swift
#if DEBUG
RemoteCapture.start("192.168.1.14")
#endif
```
When InjectionIII is running, select the "Remote/Start Server" menu item to start the
server and then run your app. It should connect to the server which will pop up a
window showing the device display and accepting tap events. Events can be
saved as `macros` and replayed. If you include a snapshot in a macro this will
be compared against the device display (within a tolerance) when you replay
the macro for automated testing. Remote can also be used to capture videos
of your app in operation but as it operates over the network, it isn't fast enough
to  capture animated transitions.

## SwiftEval - Yes, it's eval() for Swift

![Icon](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190m/10su/lectures/slides/images/drevil.png)

SwiftEval is a [single Swift source](InjectionBundle/SwiftEval.swift) you can add to your iOS simulator
or macOS projects to implement an eval function inside classes that inherit from NSObject.
There is a generic form which has the following signature:

```Swift
extension NSObject {
	public func eval<T>(_ expression: String, _ type: T.Type) -> T {
```

This takes a Swift expression as a String and returns an entity of the type specified.
There is also a shorthand function for expressions of type String which accepts the
contents of the String literal as it's argument:

```Swift
	public func eval(_ expression: String) -> String {
	    return eval("\"" + expression + "\"", String.self)
	}
```

An example of how it is used can be found in the EvalApp example.

```Swift
    @IBAction func performEval(_: Any) {
        textView.string = eval(textField.stringValue)
    }

    @IBAction func closureEval(_: Any) {
        if let block = eval(closureText.stringValue, (() -> ())?.self) {
            block()
        }
    }
```

### eval() implementation

The code works by adding an extension to your class source containing the expression.
It then compiles and loads this new version of the class "swizzling" this extension onto
the original class. The expression can refer to instance members in the class containing
the eval class and global variables & functions  in other class sources.
